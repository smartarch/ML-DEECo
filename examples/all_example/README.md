# ALl example of ML-DEECo usage

This example shows how to implement all the predictions defined in the taxonomy in the paper in `ml_deeco`. It is intended as reference code without any further documentation. The underlying components are based on the `simple_example` with truck and packages.

This example serves mainly as a test that all the possibilities work in the implementation.
